Code Project

Using the Twitter api construct a command line twitter search utility.

We should be able to cd into the project folder and run:
$ twitter_search "some search phrase"

The output should be the total count of the search results with a list of the
first 25 results outputted to STDOUT. After each result, you should also output 
the twitter user for that result and a link to that user's profile.

You cannot use the rails framework or any twitter api gems.

You have 48 hours to push this project to your github account or you may zip 
the project up and email to us.

Do not create a gem out of this utility. It can just be a simple set of utility
scripts enclosed in a single folder (a gem like structure is ok, but not a full gem).
