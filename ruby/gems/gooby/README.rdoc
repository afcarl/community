= Gooby = Google APIs + Ruby 

Gooby is a set of Ruby code to assist you in creating Google Maps (html), 
and Google Earth maps (kml), from data exported from your Garmin GPS devices.

The typical uses of Gooby are to create maps of your running, cycling, or
hiking events, though Gooby is suitable for mapping any outdoor activity.

Gooby version 2.0.0 is available from RubyForge at http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3083 

Coming soon; Gooby version 3.0, on GitHub!
