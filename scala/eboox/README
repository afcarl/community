= eboox

"eboox" is an ebook generator written in the scala programming language.  
Its purpose is to allow you to generate your own ebooks, with your content, 
for your reader or tablet devices.  eboox currently supports the "epub" format, 
allowing you to create ebooks for the iPad.

An epub file is essentially just a zip file, in a certain specific format, with
the suffix ".epub" instead of ".zip".  Both "content" and "metadata" files are
contained within an epub file.  The content is XHTML, CSS, and certain common
image types.  The metadata files are in XML format.  They primarily list the
contents of the file, as well as the table of contents of the ebook.

Using eboox, you still have to create your own content files.  However, eboox
will generate the complex and correlated metadata files for you from a simple
configuration file (config.txt) that is in the root directory of your ebook
content.  eboox will also generate a packaging script that you can run to 
create the *.epub file for your book.

The typical and intended use case for eboox is to allow you to create a reference
ebook from your personal notes of any kind - technical topics, travel plans, cookbooks,
etc.

== Download

The eboox source code and sample files are available on github.

git clone git@github.com:cjoakim/eboox.git


== Installation

eboox is written in the scala programming language. It requires that Java
version 1.6 or above (see http://www.java.com/), and Scala 2.8.1 or above
(see http://www.scala-lang.org/) are installed on your computer.

After installing Java and Scala, next create a directory on your computer
for your ebook.  Use the git program, as shown above, to download the
eboox code to your new directory.  See http://git-scm.com/ if you don't
already have git installed on your computer.

For example:
  cd ~
  mkdir books
  cd books
  git clone git@github.com:cjoakim/eboox.git

The maven (mvn) tool is required to build/compile the eboox code.
See http://maven.apache.org/ for download and usage instructions.
To build the eboox code, run the following commands:

  mvn clean install

The first time you run this command, you'll probably see very verbose
output which displays the files that maven is downloading and caching.
Ultimately, near the end of the maven output, you should see the lines:

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, it is recommended that you use the "epubcheck" program to
validate your generated epub files.  See http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/.


== Usage

First, be sure that you have installed all required software, and have
compiled the eboox project with "mvn clean install" as described above.

Next, create a directory on your computer which contains the "raw" content
for your ebook.  This directory should have a similar structure to the
example "fun_with_latin_book" directory which comes with the eboox codebase.

Your book directory MUST contain a "config.txt" file which contains the
various configuration parameters for your ebook.

Then edit the "eboox.sh" (unix/linux/mac) or "eboox.bat" (windows).  See the
two comments in this file, and change the location of your scala lib directory, 
and also the command line value of the config.txt file for your ebook.
Then run the eboox.sh or eboox.bat file.

You'll see output like the following.  It will generate the necessary 
metadata files for your ebook, as well as a packaging script.
